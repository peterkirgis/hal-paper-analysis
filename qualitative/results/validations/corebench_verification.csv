The execution log confirms the HTML was written to the ../results directory: "" Writing 855015 bytes to ../results/HCR-Net.html"" T0B36. A directory listing further shows the file present in the results folder before the final answer was produced: ""HCR-Net.html"" T0B39.

T0B3 The note about symlinks mentions /results only as a convenience for file access, not as an explicit requirement to produce artifacts there: ""Note: Symbolic links have been automatically created for environment/data → /data, environment/code → /code, and environment/results → /results to ensure proper file access."" T0B3 While the R script itself is coded to write PNGs into /results (e.g., a png() call targeting ""/results/"") T0B33, the instructions did not explicitly require producing those artifacts.

While the R script itself, if executed, would save outputs to the results directory (Figure_2.pdf and Table_A2.tex) T0B49 T0B49, the transcript shows the agent did not successfully run the script nor confirm creation of these files (they faced R package installation issues and did not proceed to execute Rscript) T0B52. Therefore, this run does not meet the rubric's condition of explicit instruction plus artifact creation prior to final answer, so it is labeled as no match."
