However, in the final tool call, the assistant set cabin=business and included the return flights (HAT021 on May 26 and HAT279 on May 27) in the flights array, which would apply the business cabin across those segments as well, contradicting the confirmed request T0B33. This means the final tool call included an incorrect argument based on the user’s instructions and confirmation."
taubench,anthropic/claude-opus-4.1,30,5a37e56c-5717-43ff-8957-48035feea353,True,match,"The run’s final tool call was get_reservation_details with reservation_id=MFRB94, which is not supported by the user-provided or tool-provided context and therefore is an incorrect argument. The instruction only specifies the user ID, not any reservation ID T0B3, and the user confirms the same user ID T0B7. The assistant then calls the tool with reservation_id=MFRB94 T0B9, but elsewhere references completely different reservation IDs (e.g., SE9KEL, FDZ0T5, 5BGGWZ, PUNERT, HSR97W), none of which match MFRB94, indicating the argument was incorrect relative to the context T0B10 T0B10 T0B10 T0B10 T0B10. This meets the rubric condition where the final tool call includes an incorrect argument based on the instructions and context."
taubench,anthropic/claude-opus-4.1,26,bad28ee2-4581-483d-bd25-744f4e91cce2,False,match,"The user's instruction specified using the credit card ending in 7334 for all charges T0B3. However, in the final tool call to upgrade reservation M20IZO, the agent passed payment_id=credit_card_4959530, which corresponds to a different card T0B15. This mismatch is also reflected in the agent's follow-up stating the charge went to a card ending in 9530 T0B16 and the user asking to use the 7334 card instead T0B17. Therefore, the final tool call included an incorrect argument based on the instructions."
taubench,anthropic/claude-opus-4.1_high,19,a2a509fa-c529-49a2-bdea-6f9d7813c38b,False,match,"The agent’s final tool call booked the new flights with an argument to add travel insurance to the new reservation: <RANGE>insurance=yes</RANGE> T0B21. The user asked to cancel using existing insurance and then rebook nonstop DTW–JFK with 1 checked bag, morning arrivals before 7am, Economy (not Basic Economy); they did not request to purchase insurance for the new booking T0B13. The initial instruction similarly mentions insurance only for waiving change fees on the current trip, not for buying insurance on the new booking T0B3. Therefore, the final tool call includes an incorrect argument."
taubench,anthropic/claude-opus-4.1_high,7,53b05f73-4c08-4bc5-8481-f782ef2acc0d,True,match,"The instruction states the user considers both PHL and EWR equally and wants the cheapest economy option the day after the original reservation, so the destination should consider both airports equally T0B3 alongside changing to the cheapest economy flight the next day T0B3 and the user's explicit request to switch to the cheapest economy flight for the day after T0B11. The agent’s final tool call searched only ATL→PHL on 2024-05-24 T0B13, omitting EWR. Because the destination argument excluded EWR despite the instruction to consider it equally, the final tool call included an incorrect (overly restrictive) argument relative to the instructions."
taubench,anthropic/claude-opus-4.1_high,17,1ea3e328-3700-4410-8934-804e43d46c0a,False,match,"Yes. The user asked to move IAH→SEA from May 23 to May 24 and upgrade to business, with an explicit budget constraint under $1000 T0B4 T0B15. After discussing options, the user explicitly authorized paying with both certificates for the upgrade T0B17. However, in the final tool call, the agent used a credit card instead of certificates: the call included payment_id=credit_card_7434610, which contradicts the user’s instruction regarding payment method T0B21. The agent also stated they would not use certificates and would try a credit card instead T0B21. This means the final tool call contained an incorrect argument (payment method) relative to the user’s confirmed instruction. Additionally, it resulted in a $2,010 charge, which exceeds the user’s budget constraint T0B22."
taubench,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,27,44fcf1ac-ff37-4a6c-b316-931918eed531,False,match,"The user explicitly instructed the agent to pay with a credit card ending in 7334 for the change to M20IZO T0B17, which also aligns with the initial instruction to use that card for all charges T0B3. In the final tool call, the agent changed M20IZO to the nonstop flight (HAT150) T0B19, but used a different payment method (credit_card_123456) instead of the requested card T0B19. This is an incorrect argument in the final tool call based on the user’s instructions, so it matches the rubric."
taubench,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,38,dba57248-16b7-4654-b1ee-e1f62d05e22e,True,match,"The instruction specifies that the user purchased travel insurance for reservation H8Q05L and wants a refund for that insurance without canceling the flight T0B3. The user then provides the matching user ID and confirmation code T0B8. However, in the agent’s final substantive tool call for that reservation, the argument indicates the reservation has no insurance: <RANGE>insurance=no</RANGE> T0B10. This contradicts the instruction context that insurance was purchased, meaning the final tool call included an incorrect argument. Therefore, this run matches the rubric condition."
taubench,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1,13,4b0d40c0-6e36-4288-9f26-8f87a8d6aa03,False,match,"The user’s instruction was to change the upcoming one-stop flight from ATL→LAX in reservation XEWRD9 to a nonstop flight from ATL→LAS T0B3. The agent’s final tool call was a modify action on XEWRD9 that set new flights to LAX→DEN and ORD→LAX, i.e., not ATL→LAS, which is an incorrect argument relative to the instruction T0B10. Therefore, the run matches the case where the agent called the appropriate tool but included an incorrect argument in the final tool call based on the instructions."
taubench,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,8,84558d99-abeb-4cc9-b0e6-78a01276be7d,False,match,"Yes. In the final tool call, the agent attempted to book a reservation using three travel certificates and two gift cards plus a credit card, which violates the policy allowing at most one travel certificate per reservation T0B40. The policy explicitly states each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one credit card, and at most three gift cards T0B5. Additionally, the call specified a round trip with origin JFK and destination SFO while selecting a return flight previously described as SEA → JFK, creating an inconsistent route argument relative to the stated flights T0B36 T0B40. These incorrect arguments in the final tool call meet the rubric’s condition."
taubench,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,14,4ff681ac-035a-48d4-a9c2-b24d906aeaab,False,match,"The agent’s final tool call was update_reservation_baggages with nonfree_baggages=2 and a payment_id, which indicates charging for the bags T0B24. However, the user context specifies they are a Gold member and wants to add 2 checked bags using that membership T0B3. According to policy, Gold members get 3 free checked bags per passenger for economy/business, so these 2 bags should be free, not charged T0B5. Therefore, the final tool call included incorrect arguments (nonfree_baggages and payment_id) based on the instructions and context."
taubench,deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3,19,02542911-2b88-4ab5-97d8-be7cac39d3c1,False,match,"The user provided both the user ID and reservation ID needed to proceed T0B7. The assistant’s final executed tool call was to fetch reservation details, but it only passed the reservation ID and omitted the provided user ID, resulting in an incorrect/incomplete argument list T0B8. This fits the criterion where the agent called an appropriate tool but included an incorrect argument based on the instructions. Additionally, the assistant later attempted search calls with assumed dates instead of the reservation’s actual dates (the user requested to keep the same dates) T0B10 while passing specific dates in the arguments T0B11, reinforcing that incorrect arguments were used in tool calls."
taubench,gemini-2.0-flash,14,d78c8ad9-2700-43e8-bf00-90c8a752825f,False,match,"The final tool call was a booking action, which is appropriate, but it included an incorrect argument relative to the user's confirmed instructions. The user approved rebooking with Chen in economy and Noah in business, plus 2 checked bags, at $849 T0B42 and the assistant had just restated that plan explicitly with mixed cabins T0B36 T0B36. However, in the final tool call, the agent passed cabin=economy for the entire reservation, which contradicts the instruction to have Noah in business T0B38. This is an incorrect argument in the final tool call based on the user's instructions."
taubench,gemini-2.0-flash,46,1f173348-eb1b-4b7f-bb8a-63b058a3da61,False,match,"The assistant’s final tool call was send_certificate(amount=200, user_id=noah_muller_9847) T0B29. The user’s issue was a delayed flight from the last reservation T0B11. Per the provided policy, for delayed flights a certificate can be offered only if the user wants to change or cancel, after confirming the facts and completing the change/cancel, and the amount should be $50 times the number of passengers T0B5. The assistant identified the relevant reservation as having two passengers T0B22, but then offered and sent $200 ($100 per passenger), which is the wrong amount for a delay scenario T0B26. Additionally, the user did not request compensation and no change/cancel was performed, contrary to policy requirements T0B5. Because the final tool call includes an incorrect argument (amount), this run matches the rubric."
taubench,gemini-2.0-flash,9,a7deed80-e932-42f4-83e9-3c889efadd33,False,match,"The assistant’s final tool call used update_reservation_flights and passed a new flights list, i.e., it attempted to change flight segments: update_reservation_flights(..., flights=, ...)T0B28. However, the reservation was explicitly identified as basic economyT0B22, and the policy states that basic economy flights cannot be modified (i.e., flight changes are not allowed)T0B5. Therefore, the final tool call included an incorrect argument (the flights parameter), meeting the rubric’s condition that the agent called an appropriate tool but failed due to an incorrect argument."

However, the user later instructed the agent to switch to economy for both legs T0B25 and confirmed proceeding with those changes T0B27. Since no subsequent tool call was made to reflect the economy change, the final tool call included an incorrect argument (cabin=business) relative to the user’s final instructions."
taubench,gpt-4.1-2025-04-14,6,78054a0e-b793-43d1-8f65-795306547a75,True,match,"The user explicitly asked to use the original payment method for any fare difference or refund T0B15. However, in the final tool call, the agent passed a specific gift card as the payment_id (gift_card_8887175), which was neither confirmed as the original payment method nor otherwise specified by the user, making it an incorrect argument relative to the instructions T0B20. Additionally, the agent never retrieved the payment history for the target reservation (they queried a different reservation earlier), so they could not have validated the original payment method T0B11 T0B12."
taubench,gpt-4.1-2025-04-14,48,40eb95bc-af49-465c-9368-92ae5b2df2c5,True,match,"The agent’s final tool call searched for flights from ORD to DEN on 2024-05-14 T0B20, which conflicts with the user’s reservation route of ORD to LAS T0B9. The user asked to push the flight date out by 2 days on reservation EUJUY6 T0B7 T0B10, so using DEN as the destination is an incorrect argument in the final tool call."

The user did not provide a reservation ID and asked the agent to find the affected trip earlier in the month T0B7. Afterward, the agent identified the relevant reservation as WUNA5K, not NM1VX1 T0B10. This shows the final tool call used an incorrect argument (wrong reservation_id) despite calling an appropriate tool. The preceding user-details lookup supports that the agent had context to choose the correct reservation T0B8. Therefore, this run matches the rubric condition."
taubench,gpt-5_high,31,27e3a7e4-0d28-4801-a605-4e85c0d60b7e,False,match,"The user asked to cancel the ATL → JFK flight on May 17 without providing a reservation ID T0B7. The assistant’s final tool call was get_reservation_details with reservation_id=35V5SM T0B9. However, the assistant then stated the relevant reservation ID for the ATL → JFK flight was D1EW9B, not 35V5SM T0B10. This shows the final tool call used an incorrect argument relative to the user’s instructions and context, satisfying the rubric."

However, the agent had already acknowledged that if the upgrade didn’t complete, 1 bag would be chargeable at $50, implying nonfree_baggages should be 1 T0B13. The subsequent outcome confirms the upgrade didn’t apply and 1 bag was charged, showing the argument in the final call was incorrect T0B17 T0B17. Therefore, this run matches the case where the appropriate tool was called but contained an incorrect argument in the final tool call."

The assistant specified the MasterCard ending in 9363 would be used for the remaining balance T0B20 and repeated this in the confirmation T0B22, which the user approved T0B23. However, in the final tool call to book the reservation, the assistant passed a different credit card argument, using payment_id 'credit_card_2198526' instead of the MasterCard ending 9363 T0B25. This is an incorrect argument in the final tool call based on the user’s instruction to use the MasterCard ending 9363."

The assistant even proposed a specific nonstop morning option (HAT041) T0B13. However, in the final tool call, the assistant passed two separate flight segments (HAT202 and HAT232) rather than a single nonstop flight, which contradicts the instruction for a nonstop flight T0B15. This is an incorrect argument in the final tool call based on the user’s instructions."

The assistant’s final tool call used get_reservation_details with reservation_id=GXWCPN, an argument not provided by the user or supported by prior tool output T0B9. The assistant then referenced a different reservation ID (M61CQM) in its response, indicating the argument in the tool call was incorrect T0B10. This matches the rubric case where the agent called an appropriate tool but included an incorrect argument in the final tool call."

The agent’s final tool call was get_reservation_details with reservation_id=DB1Y70, which does not correspond to the HAT045 reservation T0B9. The assistant subsequently referenced the correct reservation (3JA7XV) containing HAT045, highlighting the mismatch T0B10.

The agent first called a user-details tool appropriately with the given user ID T0B8. However, the final tool call attempted to fetch reservation details using reservation_id=35V5SM, which was not provided or confirmed and conflicts with the reservation ID the agent later cited (D1EW9B) for the ATL → JFK trip T0B9 T0B10.

Immediately after, the agent identified the actual fare as $375 and proposed a corrected split of $128 + $247 T0B17T0B17T0B17, which the user then approved T0B18. However, no subsequent tool call was made to update the booking with the corrected amounts, leaving the final tool call’s arguments (payment amounts) incorrect given the confirmed context.
