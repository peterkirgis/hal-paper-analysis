Additionally, they tried to use inspect_file_as_text on a .yml file, which the tool did not support, and then repeated the same failing call despite the prior error, indicating improper handling of tool constraints T0B30T0B31. These are tool use failures not attributable to environmental constraints preventing success, thus meeting the rubric for a match."

- Using the file inspection tool on unsupported source files (.R and .Rmd) despite errors indicating those formats were not supported, instead of switching to appropriate methods like shell viewing or the file editor. This occurred first for an R script T0B33 and again for an R Markdown file T0B96.
- Misusing the Python interpreter by importing disallowed modules, contrary to the documented constraints (“Import of os is not allowed”), rather than relying on the permitted tools for filesystem inspection T0B49.
- Attempting to perform direct file I/O with open() inside the restricted Python interpreter, which is explicitly forbidden, instead of using the provided file-reading tool T0B93.
- Constructing invalid grep expressions, leading to repeated shell errors due to unmatched parentheses, indicating incorrect tool command usage rather than an environmental limitation T0B52.
These constitute failures to use the available tools properly, independent of environment constraints, satisfying the rubric’s criteria for a match."

When an initial attempt to list the directory with Python failed due to a restricted module error (""Forbidden access to module: posixpath""), the agent switched to bash to achieve the same goal, which succeeded T0B7 T0B10. The agent attempted to read environment.yml with the file-inspector and received an unsupported format exception, then properly fell back to reading it via bash, indicating tool limitation rather than misuse T0B33 T0B36. Dependency installation via requirements.txt failed due to version incompatibilities (matplotlib metadata generation error), which the agent addressed by installing modern equivalents and the missing bidict package; this reflects environment constraints rather than tool misuse T0B39 T0B55 T0B71. The agent ran demo.py, encountered a plotting argument issue and corrected it via sed, then created the missing results directory and reran successfully—demonstrating correct tool use without misuse T0B74 T0B74 T0B77. They enumerated output images and used the vision model to extract the required color information from the correct figure, then returned the final answer using the final_answer tool, which indicates proper use of the tools end-to-end T0B87 T0B94 T0B101. Therefore, there is no instance of tool use failure attributable to the agent."

It located the repository contents via bash listings to find the notebook T0B13, inspected files using the file inspector tool (README and the notebook) rather than opening files directly T0B15 T0B29, and executed shell commands with execute_bash at each step. A minor command error occurred when attempting to add a non-existent pip flag (-y) T0B39, but this was immediately corrected by reinstalling without the flag T0B41. When creating ../results failed due to permissions, the agent adapted to use the provided environment/results location (an environment constraint rather than a misuse) T0B52 and successfully created environment/results T0B58. It then executed the notebook to HTML with the correct flags to disable timeouts and allow errors T0B60, and the conversion completed successfully T0B61T0B61. There is no evidence of failing to use the provided tools properly; the only hiccups were an invalid pip flag (promptly fixed) and a directory permission issue stemming from the environment, not from improper tool usage."

First, it tried to call other tools from within the python_interpreter tool, e.g., invoking inspect_file_as_text in a python_interpreter call instead of using the tool directly T0B8. It then continued this pattern (e.g., calling file_content_search inside python_interpreter) instead of using the tool directly T0B11. The agent also repeatedly pasted long prose (task instructions with bullet characters) into python_interpreter, causing SyntaxError due to non-code content T0B93, a misuse repeated multiple times (e.g., directly passing prose as raw_value) T0B97. The agent also misapplied file_content_search to locate files by name (it searches file contents, not filenames), yielding no matches T0B10. These are clear tool use errors and not constraints of the environment. Consequently, this run should be marked as a match."

First, it tried to import a disallowed module via ""from pathlib import Path"" and received an error stating that such imports are not allowed T0B13. It then repeated the same approach again immediately after, reusing the pathlib import in its code, demonstrating failure to adapt to the tool's constraints T0B14.

The agent also repeatedly attempted to use the forbidden open() function within python_interpreter to read files, receiving explicit errors that open() is not allowed, yet trying again multiple times. This occurred when reading README T0B17 and then was repeated shortly after with the same open() pattern T0B24. Later, the agent again attempted to write a file using open(), which is likewise disallowed, and received the same class of error T0B49, and then repeated that attempt yet again T0B50.

These are clear instances of failing to use the provided tool properly (ignoring its restrictions), and are not due to external environment constraints like missing system binaries. The environment-related failure (Rscript not found) is separate and not the basis for this judgment T0B52. Therefore, this run qualifies as a tool use failure under the rubric."

(2) Using open() inside python_interpreter to read files, which is explicitly forbidden by the sandbox, and repeating it after the error T0B17 T0B24. (3) Importing and using os.path.join within python_interpreter, which is not in the allowed modules list, leading to a sandbox error T0B49. (4) Passing an unescaped parenthesis to file_content_search, causing a regex error, instead of using a literal or escaped pattern T0B27.
