First, it tried to read a README that did not exist and failed, as shown by the file-not-found error for 'README.md' T0B9. It then revised its approach by listing directory contents and proceeded to use the discovered requirements file successfully T0B13 and read its contents T0B17. Later, it attempted to locate 'Main.py' via a direct search and found nothing T0B38, but revised its search method to grep the codebase and successfully found a reference to the needed file path in /code T0B46. These instances meet the rubric by showing an unsuccessful navigation attempt with subsequent successful navigation."
corebench,openai/gemini-2.0-flash,capsule-9240688,3b7418d5-3619-4219-a5e7-72e9acf6f219,False,no match,"The agent repeatedly failed to locate or navigate to required files and never achieved a subsequent successful navigation. It first failed to find the 'manuscript' file T0B7, then attempted to run a missing 'run.sh' T0B30. It pivoted to running a Python script but encountered dependency/import errors (weave/pydantic) and could not proceed T0B36. When checking for results, the expected results directory was absent T0B84. Despite multiple retries (dependency pinning, editing files), the agent never successfully navigated to obtain figure 3 or table 1, nor did it produce outputs to extract the required information T0B183. Therefore, there was an initial unsuccessful attempt but no subsequent successful navigation to the needed information."

It then adapted its navigation by listing the research code directory and identifying a README there T0B21. Subsequently, it successfully read the README from the correct location, as evidenced by producing content under the header indicating it had retrieved the research README contents T0B30. This sequence demonstrates an initial unsuccessful navigation followed by a successful one, satisfying the rubric."

It then revised its approach by switching to a bash-based listing, which succeeded as indicated by a successful exit code T0B10. Following this, the agent navigated to the code directory and successfully located the target scripts needed for the task, confirming the subsequent successful navigation T0B17 T0B17."

It then revised its approach by switching to bash-based exploration, successfully listing contents and locating the R scripts T0B10 and T0B13. Later, when trying to read .R files via the inspect_file_as_text tool, it encountered an unsupported format error T0B30. The agent corrected course by using shell tools (head/grep) to extract dependencies from the R files, which succeeded as shown by the extracted library statements T0B33. These demonstrate unsuccessful navigation attempts followed by successful navigation to find necessary information in the repository, matching the rubric."

Specifically, the initial attempt failed with an error stating the import of subprocess is not allowed T0B7. The agent then switched to using shell commands and successfully located the key files, including the README and the R Markdown notebook T0B13. Later, the agent also tried to read the Rmd with an unsupported tool and failed T0B30, then corrected by reading the file content via shell, successfully accessing its contents T0B33. These instances show an unsuccessful navigation/read attempt followed by successful navigation to the needed information, satisfying the rubric."

It then revised its approach and successfully extracted needed information by grepping the script for dependencies, listing the library calls T0B17. The agent further switched to using shell tools (sed/grep) to read the script content, successfully locating the data path used by the script T0B33. Later, after a failed attempt to load the data directly from /data (FileNotFoundError) T0B36, it adjusted by targeting the environment/data path in subsequent code T0B45. These demonstrate an initial unsuccessful navigation attempt followed by successful navigation to find the needed information."

It then revised its approach by explicitly listing repository contents and successfully reading the README and R scripts, followed by running the pipeline and producing outputs, demonstrating successful navigation. The logs show the analysis ran to completion T0B11, the expected results files were generated T0B11, and the agent extracted the requested information T0B11."

It then tried to read the file using Python's open() inside the restricted interpreter and failed again due to sandbox limitations T0B17. After these unsuccessful navigation attempts, the agent revised its approach and successfully navigated the repository by using shell commands to view the script contents, extracting the required package imports T0B27 and locating the specific CTCF analysis section with grep and targeted line extraction T0B33 T0B49. This demonstrates an initial unsuccessful navigation followed by a successful one."

First, it tried to explore the repository using a Python directory walk, which failed due to restricted modules T0B7. It then revised its approach, using shell commands to list and locate key files in the repository, including the required ROC evaluation script T0B17, and confirming the presence of the README T0B17. The agent further verified that the three target scripts existed by checking their paths and receiving explicit existence confirmations T0B36.

It encountered another unsuccessful step when running the ROC script due to a missing output directory T0B52 and lacked permission to create it at the root path T0B55. The agent revised its strategy by creating a local results directory and updating the script to save there T0B58, after which the script ran successfully T0B109 and produced the expected output image T0B112.

Similarly, when seeking input data, it first failed to find the CSV at the expected absolute path T0B87, then successfully located it within the repository’s data folder T0B90 and modified the feature selection scripts to use relative paths, leading to successful execution for both the accuracy T0B125 and loss scripts T0B131.

These episodes show a clear pattern of an initial failed navigation attempt followed by a corrected and successful navigation to find and use the necessary files, matching the rubric."
