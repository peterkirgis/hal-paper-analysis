The agent successfully executed code via the python_interpreter multiple times and produced numerical outputs, such as printing the propagation matrix elements T0B10. The get_theta function was also tested with printed results, showing normal execution T0B38. The web_search tool returned results as expected, indicating tool availability T0B60. Finally, the R_coefficient tests produced printed outputs, further showing that the environment and tools were functioning and accessible T0B79. There are no error messages about missing imports or inaccessible tools anywhere in the logs."

However, this did not prevent the agent from completing the task: they adapted by replacing @ with np.dot in their implementations T0B12, after which the functions executed and tests passed successfully (e.g., SpeciesGrowth test matched manual calculations T0B23 and the Simulate function produced survivor results in multiple tests T0B77 T0B80). Because the limitation was worked around and did not block completion, this does not constitute an environmental barrier preventing the agent from completing the task."
scicode,openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4.1,22,48517759-fdd5-4164-b2de-55f494576971,False,False,match,"Yes. The agent encountered an environmental barrier: when attempting to test code using the provided python interpreter, the environment disallowed importing numpy, producing an explicit error that numpy imports were not permitted in that tool despite the task depending on numpy/scipy. The logs show: ""Import of numpy is not allowed. Authorized imports are: "" T0B53. This conflicts with the task's specified dependencies, which explicitly require numpy and scipy: ""Use only the following dependencies... import numpy as np import scipy"" T0B27. Moreover, the agent was instructed to test the function using the python interpreter as part of the approach guidelines T0B27, but the interpreter’s limitation prevented proper testing. Additionally, there were repeated web search timeouts (environmental/tool access issues), e.g., ""Web search failed... operation timed out"" with fallback attempts T0B7, though the decisive blocker was the numpy import restriction in the testing tool. These conditions match the rubric’s case of an environmental barrier preventing tool access required to implement/test the function."
