All subsequent pricing information came from that same site, such as daily tickets ""As Low As $40"" T0B44 and the 2026 Gold Pass payment details T0B55 T0B55.

The TripAdvisor rating also appears directly in the Google results (4.7 (133)) T0B48. Beyond ratings, it triangulated family-friendliness by using a Reddit thread of family recommendations T0B36 alongside TripAdvisor forum posts shown in the search results T0B48.

The search results also surfaced the site’s stated hours (Monday to Friday: 5:45 AM to 9 PM), which the agent used as corroboration T0B48.

They then proceeded to the Kartcenter Cologne official site to seek an address rather than corroborating via a separate source like a map or another directory T0B45.

The agent also proceeded despite lacking distances, extracting results with null distances and then finalizing the answer without cross-checking elsewhere T0B11 T0B21 T0B25. Even when reopening a tab, it was just Google Maps again, not a second independent source T0B22."

It then performed a separate Google search to assess proximity to the Mummers Museum, indicating use of a second source T0B18. The Google results included a Yelp snippet identifying Woolly Mammoth at 430 South St near one of the candidate addresses T0B20, and the agent explicitly referenced using these Google results to select the final answer T0B21. This demonstrates the agent tried to double check by consulting a second source."

They then finalized an answer based on assumed co-location rather than cross-checking, stating this inference explicitly T0B50 and submitting the result T0B50.
