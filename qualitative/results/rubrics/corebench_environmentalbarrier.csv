For example, an initial tool restriction prevented importing subprocess within the Python interpreter, but the agent pivoted to bash execution instead T0B7. A specific dependency version could not be installed, yet the agent installed newer compatible versions and proceeded (older PyTorch failed to resolve; newer torch and transformers were installed) T0B61 T0B64.

The code initially failed due to write permissions on the expected /data path, but the agent adjusted paths and continued T0B80 T0B58. A BERT model path validation error was also resolved by redirecting to the local model path T0B118. When a state_dict key mismatch arose, the agent relaxed loading strictness and proceeded T0B140 T0B143. Finally, a mask dtype runtime error in the CRF code was fixed by adjusting the mask to boolean, allowing the test to run to completion and produce metrics T0B153 T0B156.

The test completed with reported metrics, demonstrating the task was successfully executed rather than blocked by an impassable environmental barrier: precision 0.7252, recall 0.6884, F1 0.7063 T0B156. The agent then produced the final answer dictionary T0B158."

Rendering also failed initially due to missing pandoc T0B58, which the agent later resolved by installing pandoc 2.5 T0B68.

Critically, essential R packages could not be installed due to environmental constraints. The gifski package required Rust and failed to build T0B55 leading to T0B55. Attempts to install tidyverse and its dependencies failed repeatedly, e.g., T0B74, and rendering modular.Rmd failed because tidyverse was missing T0B90.

Additionally, the environment blocked writing to the required results directory. Rendering to /results or ../results failed with permission errors T0B87T0B87 and similarly for ../results T0B77T0B77. Direct file copy into ../results was also denied T0B93T0B138.

Because of these impassable environmental barriers—insufficient permissions to write to the mandated results directory and inability to install required R packages under the provided R version—the agent could not complete the task as specified (rendering modular.Rmd to HTML and storing it in ../results with clean=TRUE), and instead resorted to ad hoc scripts.
