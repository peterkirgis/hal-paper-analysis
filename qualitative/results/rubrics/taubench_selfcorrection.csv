The agent initially asks for both user ID and reservation ID T0B6, the user cannot provide the reservation ID T0B7, and the agent proceeds to look up the user and the likely reservation directly via tools T0B8 T0B9. This is a straightforward workflow, not a self-correction. The agent then correctly identifies that Basic Economy cannot be modified T0B10, gathers the necessary confirmation and reason before canceling T0B12, and performs the final cancellation tool call T0B14. There is no earlier erroneous action that is later fixed."

After that, the assistant referenced a different reservation (WUNA5K) in text T0B10, but did not issue a corrective tool call. The assistant’s stance on membership also remained consistent (stating the profile shows Regular) rather than correcting an earlier error T0B12. There is no evidence of self-correction via subsequent tool use after an intermediate mistake, so this run does not match the rubric."

No self-correction is demonstrated after an intermediate error; the agent never revisits or fixes earlier steps."

The user requested downgrading all business flights to economy without changing flights or passengers T0B4. The agent planned the process and asked for the user ID T0B6, then executed only two tool calls: one to downgrade the cabin for reservation JG7FMM T0B12 and one to update baggages for that same reservation T0B13. Despite later claiming that five reservations were downgraded T0B14, there is no subsequent correction acknowledging the discrepancy or issuing additional tool calls to actually perform those other downgrades. The final tool call (baggage update) did not remedy a prior oversight; it aligned with the agent’s earlier plan to charge for 1 extra bag on JG7FMM T0B10, which was not a self-correction of an earlier error. Therefore, this run does not exhibit the kind of self-correction described in the rubric."

Before this final call, the assistant had already concluded that the reservation did not include insurance and stated that insurance cannot be added after booking T0B9 T0B9. After the final tool call, the assistant reaffirmed the same conclusion (no insurance on the booking and cannot add it now), rather than correcting an earlier mistake T0B14 T0B14.

After the user asked to upgrade XEHM4B to economy and then cancel, the agent immediately clarified that upgrading to economy would not enable cancellation and proposed upgrading to business instead, before taking any action T0B10 T0B12. This stance was consistent with the agent’s earlier assessment that XEHM4B (basic economy, no insurance) was not cancelable for a change of plan and that 59XX6W required a health or weather reason despite having insurance T0B9 T0B9. The final tool actions—upgrading XEHM4B to business and then canceling—were aligned with this plan and did not reflect a correction of a prior error T0B16 T0B17.

After the user provided them T0B9, the agent made the final tool call to fetch reservation details T0B10 and concluded the ticket was not eligible for cancellation under policy T0B11.

After retrieving details, the agent immediately explained why the reservation could not be canceled and maintained that position throughout the rest of the conversation, without any self-correction T0B10. When the user introduced new information about prior insurance, the agent reiterated that insurance does not carry over and did not change course, which is consistent rather than self-corrective T0B11 T0B12.

The agent also reported that there were no 1‑stop return options arriving before 7:00 am and offered the earliest arrivals instead; the user then chose an option that did not meet the original arrival-before-7 constraint, which the agent executed without any prior error to fix T0B18 T0B19. While the assistant’s pre-change estimate predicted a refund but the final outcome was a charge, the assistant did not acknowledge or correct an earlier mistake; it simply reported the final result, which is a discrepancy rather than a self-correction T0B20 T0B23.

When the user insists on silver-member benefits, the agent reiterates that membership does not change the policy T0B11 T0B12 and again confirms no refund is possible T0B16.
